I am a new programmer so be chill,fellas.
Will just open a new window of your browser,that you can use as a spotify client

It requires python3,xfce4-terminal and a browser with ublock installed

Step 1: create a launcher on the desktop name it spotify and as command type 
  >xfce4-terminal -x python3 /your/path/spotify.py 

and save it

optional:i'll include the png of the spotify logo if you want a more refined look

Step 2:enjoy=)
